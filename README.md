<h1>Popular K-pop Group: Seventeen!</h1>
<h2><i>circa May 26, 2015</i></h2>
<hr size="3" width="100%" color="grey">
<p>The members in this group include S-Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino!</p>
<p> My bias, or favorite member, is <strong>Dino</strong> (he needs more spotlight :(( )! But all the members are very talented especially in dance!</p>
<p>What makes Seventeen special is the fact that they self-produce the majority of their songs as well as the choreography!</p>

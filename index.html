  <hr size="3" width="100%" color="white">

  My bias, or favorite member, is <strong>Dino</strong> (he needs more spotlight)! But all the members are very talented especially in dance!

  <p> What makes Seventeen special is the fact that they self-produce the majority of their songs as well as the choreography! </p>
